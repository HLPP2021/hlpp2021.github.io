# HLPP 2021 Submission

## Submission Format 

Papers submitted to HLPP 2021 must describe original research results and must not have been published or simultaneously submitted anywhere else. As it is traditional for HLPP symposia, the accepted papers will be distributed at the symposium in draft proceedings, and revised papers will be published in the special issue of an international journal (the name of the journal is to be confirmed). In the past years, the journals were the International Journal of Parallel Programming and The Journal of Supercomputing.

Manuscripts must be prepared with the Springer IJSS latex macro package using the single column option (\documentclass[smallextended]{svjour3}) and submitted via the EasyChair Conference Management System as one pdf file. The strict page limit for initial submission and camera-ready version is 20 pages in the aforementioned format.

Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews by members of the international technical program committee. Papers will be selected based on their originality, relevance, technical clarity and quality of presentation. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the HLPP 2021 symposium and present the paper.

After the symposium the authors of the accepted papers will have ample time to revise their papers and to incorporate the potential comments and remarks of their colleagues. We expect the HLPP 2021 special issue to appear by mid-2022.
